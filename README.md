this is a server and client files the project is not finished ill be making changes, what does it do?
it will connect to a server (local or private ip) and then u can connect the client by running first "python3 server.py" and then on another terminal "python3 client.py" 
(you can connect multiple clients to one server)
the features of this project are !DISC which quits the client on this specific terminal but the server will keep running, to fully quit the server run: !DISCALL which will end all clients and the server 
,also another feature the "enable ghost" which will change your name to [GHOST] every time u write as i said ill be adding more features like disabling the ghost mode and more.
